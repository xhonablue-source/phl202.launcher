        ## Thursday ‚Ä¢ Conceptual Framework
        
        ### Today's Learning Objectives:
        - **Understand** the three main branches of philosophical inquiry
        - **Explore** fundamental questions in each branch
        - **Connect** philosophical concepts to everyday life
        - **Practice** philosophical thinking and reasoning
        
        > *"Philosophy begins in wonder."* ‚Äî Aristotle
        
        **The Three Branches We'll Explore:**
        1. ü§î **Metaphysics** - What exists?
        2. üß† **Epistemology** - How do we know?
        3. ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethics** - How should we live?

        # üå≥ Visualizing Philosophy as a Tree
        
        ## The Metaphor:
        Think of philosophy as a great tree with three main branches, each reaching toward different fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, and values.
        
        ### üåø Branch 1: Metaphysics
        **The Nature of Reality**
        - What exists?
        - What is real vs. illusion?
        - Do abstract things (numbers, ideas) exist?
        - Is there a God or ultimate reality?
        
        ### üåø Branch 2: Epistemology  
        **The Nature of Knowledge**
        - How do we know things?
        - What makes beliefs justified?
        - Can we have certain knowledge?
        - What are the limits of human understanding?
        
        ### üåø Branch 3: Ethics
        **The Nature of Right and Wrong**
        - What makes actions right or wrong?
        - How should we live?
        - What is the good life?
        - What do we owe to others?
        
        ## üîó How They Connect:
        These branches intertwine - your view of reality affects how you think we can know things, which affects how you think we should act.

        ### Key Areas of Investigation:
        
        **üåå Existence & Being**
        - What does it mean for something to exist?
        - Why is there something rather than nothing?

        - Does the past still exist?
        
        **üî¢ Abstract Objects**
        - Do numbers exist independently of human minds?
        - What about concepts like justice or beauty?
        
        ## üí≠ Famous Metaphysical Questions:
        - If you replace every part of a ship, is it still the same ship?
        - Do you remain the same person throughout your life?
        - Could there be multiple universes?
        - Is everything predetermined or do we have free will?

        2. **Relevance:** These questions matter for daily life
        3. **Ongoing:** Philosophy is a process, not a destination
        4. **Personal:** Your philosophical views shape how you see everything
        
        ## üìù Reflection Assignment:
        
        **Choose ONE branch that interests you most and write 2-3 paragraphs:**
        
        1. **Explain** the branch in your own words
        2. **Identify** a specific question from that branch that intrigues you
        3. **Connect** it to something in your own life or current events
        4. **Explore** different possible answers (you don't need to solve it!)
        
        ## üöÄ Looking Ahead:
        
        **Next Class:** We'll dive deeper into one specific philosophical method - logical argumentation and critical thinking skills.
        
        **Coming Up:** Applications to religion, ethics, politics, science, and art.
        
        ### üåü Remember:
        Philosophy isn't about memorizing what ancient Greeks thought - it's about learning to think more clearly and deeply about the questions that matter most to human life.
